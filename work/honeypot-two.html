  Honeypot is a developer-focused job platform, on a mission to get every developer a great job. Honeypot believe developers should have all the information they need to choose a job they love: whether thatâ€™s based on a cutting-edge tech stack, an inspiring team or just good old-fashioned salary. That means no more spam and empty promises from headhunters, no more sending the same application to multiple companies - just one profile and the choice to receive  honest offers related to your job preferences direct from companies.

  <h2 align="left">My Approach</h2>
<br>
  <p>
    I helped my old collagues at Honeypot with their new landingpages. We wanted a more modern and playful but still professional approach. I created patterns, illustrations and a new color scheme which is a bit more calm for the eye. There was 4 pages, one for talents, one for employers, the about page and community. I wanted to differentiate the pages a bit and decided to do it with colors instead of style.
