  <p class="that-box-thing__right">
    Mindmatch is an HR tool that allows recruiters to assess how well a candidate fits a position without the recruiter having to leave their Applicant Tracking System (ATS) of choice.  In order to assess a candidate’s cultural and technical fit to a position, recruiters are forced to manually aggregate quantifiable and qualitative data from many different sources (CV, code performance, linkedin and github profiles.)  Taking the form of a browser plugin, Mindmatch eases this process by aggregating all this data to determine if a candidate is a potential match with the position.

  <h2 align="left">My Approach</h2>
<br>
  <p>
     I Joined the core team as their designer from the start. We kickstarted the project in a span of 2 weeks in accordance with Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky and Braden Kowitz’s strict sprint creation. Researching, sketching, creating storyboards, questioning everything. In addition to creating the branding, I was tasked with designing an overlay that could function on a variety of ATS systems. I created 5 prototypes that underwent 15 user testings.  I worked closely with a group of developers and data scientists to understand how to best visually represent their complex data and machine learning processes.  The end goal was to present data of complex origins in a simple and elegant way that any type of HR employee would understand.
