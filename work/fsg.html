    FSG festival is the Finland’s gymnastics festival which takes place every four years.  Averaging over 1300 attendees, it was clear to the organizers that they were in need of a graphic identity. I was tasked to create a brand that aligned with the festival’s joyful motto: “Come together and make memories”

  <h2 align="left">My Approach</h2>
<br>
  <p>
    As the lead designer of the FSG Festival I was responsible for the execution of every asset from start to finish.  During a year of planning, I branded the entire conference.  Every detail  from the billboards to the the socks, to the pins, posters and brochures were my responsibility.  I worked closely with the core organizers and for many of them I was the first designer they'd met or worked with. I had the pleasure of introducing and explaining my design concepts and processes.
