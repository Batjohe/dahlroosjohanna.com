<p>
 Lilipad is a non-profit initiative that aims to facilitate access to education by providing books and setting up libraries in underprivileged schools. Lilipad's first library was built in Uganda in March 2017. In September 2017, they will be heading to Lakhdara Primary School in the outskirts of Casablanca (Lissasfa) for a second round of books. Lilipad will also renovate and provide an educational library, so that the children can have access to "fun" books to borrow and take home whenever they want to. Lilipad was founded in December 2016 and is based in Berlin, Germany.
