  <p class="that-box-thing__right">
    Mindmatch is an HR tool that allows recruiters to assess how well a candidate fits a position without the recruiter having to leave their Applicant Tracking System (ATS) of choice.  In order to assess a candidateâ€™s cultural and technical fit to a position, recruiters are forced to manually aggregate quantifiable and qualitative data from many different sources (CV, code performance, linkedin and github profiles.)  Taking the form of a browser plugin, Mindmatch eases this process by aggregating all this data to determine if a candidate is a potential match with the position.

<br>
  <p>
     I Joined the core team as their designer from the start and this time the project was to develop the landingpages. To dig deepend into a more explainable way to communicate what the product is doing and visualize it.
