    I joined Honeypot in October 2015 - as their lead designer I've worked alot with blog content and research reports on the side of my web projects. Assets including illustrations, graphs, blog covers and so on. We researched 4 of the leading tech european cities and created reports from what we found.

  <h2 align="left">London Tech Map</h2>
<br>
<p>
  In its 2015 edition of the Global Startup Ecosystem Ranking, Compass estimated that London has between 3,000 and 5,000 active tech startups with a value of $44 billion, which makes London the fourth largest startup ecosystem in the world. We created an interactive tech map for developers to learn about opportunities in the city. We took a sample of over 800 London tech companies currently hiring developers and sorted them by industry and programming language, to judge which developer skills are most in demand in London.

  <h2 align="left">Amsterdam Tech Map</h2>
<br>
<p>
  Amsterdam’s lifestyle is world famous. But how are the Dutch when it comes to building and scaling tech companies? And what is life like for software developers in Amsterdam? To answer this question we gathered a sample of over 170 tech companies, classified them by industry and mapped them onto the city. In previous editions of our startup map, we mapped the startups by train-lines. Given the influence of the humble bike on the Dutch capital, we took out the trains lines and surrendered to the streets.

  <h2 align="left">Munich Tech Map</h2>
<br>
<p>
  While Berlin is the capital of Germany, Munich is its economic heartland. The Bavarian capital has the highest purchasing power of any German city and many of large German companies are headquartered here, including global corporations such as Allianz, BMW, MAN, Munich Re, and Siemens. But what does Munich have to offer software developers? To figure that out, we created the Munich Tech Map, a guide to jobs and companies in the city for software developers. We mapped 200 tech companies (both startups and corporates) based in Munich, classified them by industry and further divided them by their programming languages. We also talked to some locals in Munich’s developer scene and soon discovered the city has a lot to offer software developers.

  <h2 align="left">Berlin Tech Map</h2>
<br>
<p>
  Did you know there are over 1800 active startup companies operating in Berlin? To discover more about them, we took a 10% sample sorted them by industry and mapped them by U-bahn station. The following post details our findings. According to EY, in 2015 growth in Germany outpaced other European tech regions such as the UK, Sweden or France. With Berlin centered at the beating heart of this growth and home to roughly 1,800 active tech statups, analysts estimate that the city's startups could create between 40,000 and 100,000 new jobs by 2020.
