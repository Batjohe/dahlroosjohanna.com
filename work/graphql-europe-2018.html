  <p class="that-box-thing__right">
    GraphQL-Europe is Europe’s biggest conference dedicated to GraphQL. GraphQL is a language shared by both server and client that increases flexibility, communication and development speed. Originally developed by Facebook in 2012, GraphQL has grown into a worldwide phenomena. With 500 attendees and 19 speakers, the project was a definitive success (and the branding clearly resonated with GraphQL professionals and enthusiasts.)

  <h2 align="left">My Approach</h2>
<br>
  <p>
    My role as the UX/UI designer was to continue to develop the brand and designs for Europe’s biggest Graph-QL conference.  My process included user research to define our target audience.  Processing the data into quantifiable findings.  My process included planning, sketching and wireframing a brand from scratch and then constant testing in order to verify the findings gathered from the research.  Once the brand and platform created I was also responsible for all advertising and the print design on all the conference's merchandise.
